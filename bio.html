      A Few Words<br>
    </h1>
    I am a sophomore in Tufts University, majoring in Computer Science and Physics.<br>
    I have lived in Athens, Greece for most of my life.<br>
    My environmental concerns have guided me to projects that combine environmental challenges and engineering.<br>
    What fascinates me most in Computer Science is understanding how machines work under the surface, and I enjoy very much designing algorithms and optimizing.<br>
    At the same time, physics is very appealing to me because it addresses how to break down a problem, 
    while also offering a level of abstraction (models).<br>
    I greatly appreciate straight-forwardness and honesty.<br>
    In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, practicing the piano and running.<br>

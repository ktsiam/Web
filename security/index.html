    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    I was hired to hack the most unhackable website of all: the Landmarks website
    <h2>Methodology and Findings</h2>
    To hack this website I used curl, as well as the bash shell language, to be able to deliver multiple requests per second consistently. I first noticed that there is no protection against injections in the post info. I used this to apply cross-site-scripting. After realizing that the server has no maximum requests from a client, I wrote a script that swarms the website with post requests making it slow and clumpsy.
    <h2>Issues Found</h2>
    <h3>Issue 1: No check for user input.<h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Location:
            Website page: https://hidden-taiga-87881.herokuapp.com/
            Code: <img src="issue-1.png" alt="bug in code">
          </li>
          The issue is quite important, as it is very easy to apply cross-site scripting and manipulate the page in any way one wants

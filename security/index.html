    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    In this assignment, I assessed the security/privacy of the Landmark web application. Some issues are illustrated, and solutions are provided for the backend of this application

    <h1>Methodology and Findings</h2>
    To exploit this website's vulnerabilities I used curl, as well as the bash shell language (to be able to deliver multiple requests per second consistently). I first noticed that there is no protection against injections in the post info. I used this to apply cross-site-scripting. After realizing that the server has no maximum requests from a client, I wrote a script that swarms the website with post requests making it slow and clumpsy.
    <h1>Issues Found</h2>
    <h3>Issue 1: No check for user input</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Location: https://hidden-taiga-87881.herokuapp.com/</br>
            File index.js never checks for questionable user input.</br></br>
            <img src="img/issue-1.png" alt="bug in code" id="proof"></br>
          </br>The issue is quite important, as it is very easy to apply cross-site scripting and manipulate the page in any way one wants.</br>
            Here you can see a redirection happening when one opens the site:</br></br>
          <h4>LOADING PAGE:</h4>
          <img src="img/redirect1.png" id="proof">
          <h4>REDIRECTION:</h4>
          <img src="img/redirect2.png" id="proof">
          </li>
          <li>To solve this, one could add a function that selects or special characters (needed for scripts) and removes them from user input, and/or keep maximum username size small. Both these should be inforced on back-end to avoid proxy attacks.</li>     
          
        </ul>
        <h3>Issue 2: No maximum number of requests</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Location: Website page: https://hidden-taiga-87881.herokuapp.com/sendLocation
              </li>
              <li>This issue is quite important but nowhere near as important as the previous one. </li>
              <li>
                With the following script, you are able to fill the database with many entries, slow down service, and (with a lot of time) reach the data limit.
                <h4>MALICIOUS SCRIPT:</h4>
                <img src="img/script.png" id="proof">
                <h4>RESULT AFTER A FEW MINUTES:</h4>
                <img src="img/checkins.png" id="proof">
              </li>
              </br>
              <li>
                To solve this problem, one could make the server ignore multiple requests from the same IP address.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            This document addressed the security/privacy issues in the given application. The vulnerabilities that were found were cross-site scripting, as well as no checking for repeated POST requests. Especially the first vulnerability could be taken advantage of in a large number of ways. However, by no means does this mean there were no more vulnerabilities in the application. The suggestion that I would make is to never trust user input, and try to regulate it as much as possible (e.g. through maximum size, etc.

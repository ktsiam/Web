The purpose of this repository is to give as a head start into getting involved with personal-team projects in an ergonomic safe platform (I think)

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
I liked assignment 2, because I got to make something beautiful (debatable) from nothing (also debatable). Just learning how to use APIs gives you so much freedom in writing functional applications.

I think I have grown a ton since day 1 of this course. This is mostly because of the work spirit and the understanding of abstractions I acquired through Comp40. However, Comp20 was a great partner to this course, as while going deep in machine level, it comes and shows you some of the most wonderful things that have been created by it, and how you can use them creatively. It also teaches you about how to learn to utilize new platforms to solve problems, as well as some must-know's of programmers.

Even though I had a bit of exposure with the stupid content tracker before, Comp20 is what made me start to consistently use it. As I use it more and more I realize how useful a skill it is and I am very grateful that I am able to use it (still don't quite get how it works though :) ). I have been building a chess engine with a friend back home, and without git this process would be much more painful.
Even though I didn't choose security as the most important thing I learned in this class, I am very very glad that you introduced us to this field, as in my opinion, everyone who studies computer science must have an understanding of basic security.

After learning about AlphaZero (from DeepMind) consistently beating the best chess engines out there (28-0 vs Stockfish), a fact that I could hardly believe when I read about it, I think I'll start learning machine learning. My goal right now is to build a neural network in C++ (to understand the mechanics of it) and then maybe work on applications that use it.
